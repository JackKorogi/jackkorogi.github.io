2. This account was made for school using my personal email because I didn't have a GitHub account and I don't mind using my personal email for this profile.
3. This repository will supposedly hold assignments for school because I can't imagine what else we'd be using it for in this class.

# About Me
## My Interests
- Since I can remember, I've always loved **video games.**
   - *I'm not the type of person to play many of different games--I've had a select few that I enjoy and commit a lot of time to.*
- Another hobby I've picked up on is **video editing.**
   - *To me, video editing is a really cool way to make my visions into reality and express myself in ways that are hard to put to words.*

## Favorite Websites
- ***[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)*** is a website I've spent so much of my life on, and for good reason.
   - *YouTube has always been a source of huge inspiration on me. It's a place where anyone can be artistic, use their voice for good, or to have fun and make others happier.*
- ***[1001 Fonts](https://www.1001fonts.com/)*** is a website I use often for video editing purposes.
   - *Through many different filters, you're able to sift through hundreds of different fonts to find one that you think is perfect for the project you're working on.*
   - *You are able to see which fonts are free to use commercially, which is really helpful. There are almost always great ones that don't require that you acquire a license.*
